Alzheimer's disease(AD) is a common disease among the elderly, and it is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease. In the later stage, 
it will cause the loss of key abilities such as language, decision-making, and self-care. Since there is no effective 
drugs, only certain treatments can be use to alleviate the condition and delay
development. Therefore the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease has important
significance for patients, and can help patients actively deal with Alzheimer's Disease. In this paper, Bi-directional Long Short-Term 
Memory(Bi-LSTM) and Adaboostmodel are constructed to predict Alzheimer's Disease
